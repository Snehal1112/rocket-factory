# rocket-factory

A standalone software factory. A Rust driver builds, checks, reviews and merges one feature at a time in a separate git worktree, and a local dashboard shows what it is doing. It was extracted from Rocket's `tools/factory` and is being generalized to drive several projects at once.

- Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-standalone-software-factory-design.md`
- Build plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-16-standalone-software-factory/`
- Contributor rules and commands: `CLAUDE.md`

Status: extracted and tested. It still behaves like Rocket's in-repo factory. The standalone work is described in the plan index.

## Layout and base branch

The driver gets every path as a value. `Layout` holds them. `Layout::in_repo` gives the layout Rocket uses today.

- `repo`: the main checkout. Default is the repo path itself.
- `state_dir`: holds `board.json`, `events.jsonl`, `costs.json` and `kb-stopped`. Default is `.superpowers/factory`.
- `jobs_dir`: one folder per job. Default is `.superpowers/sdd`.
- `worktrees_dir`: one folder per job worktree. Default is `.claude/worktrees`.
- `config_file`: the factory config. Default is `.claude/factory/config.toml`.
- `commit_context_file`: the context the committer prompt reads. Default is `.claude/factory/commit-context.md`.

The config key `base_branch` is the branch jobs start from and merge into. The default is `main`. A name that git would refuse makes the whole config invalid. So does a name that starts with `factory/`. The driver then falls back to the fail-closed config.

## Projects and presets

The factory keeps its own files in a home folder: `$FACTORY_HOME`, or `~/.factory` when it is not set.

```
<home>/presets/<preset>/{config.toml,commit-context.md,agents/}   seeded from the built-in presets (rust, go)
<home>/projects/<name>/{project.toml,agents/,state/,worktrees/}    one folder per registered project
```

The `project` commands work on the home only, so they run outside a git repository:

```
factory project add /path/to/repo --preset rust [--base main] [--name demo]
factory project list
factory project show demo
factory project remove demo [--force]
```

`add` needs the top folder of a git repository and stores the base branch it used (`--base`, or the branch the
repo is on). The name defaults to the lowercased repo folder name. `list` shows a project whose repo is gone as
`disabled`. `show` prints the resolved settings, the folders, the number of risk paths, the agent file names and
any problems; a project whose settings failed closed is marked `degraded`. `remove` deletes only the project
folder and refuses while a job is not merged or cancelled, unless `--force` is given. A project with an unreadable
`project.toml` is removed only with `--force`. `remove` also prunes the git worktree registrations of the
project's `worktrees/` folder (a stale one whose folder is gone too, a valid one together with its working
folder). It never deletes branches: the `factory/*` job branches stay in the repo and are listed in the output.

### Running against a project

`factory --project <name> <command>` runs a command against a registered project, from any folder. It cannot be
combined with `--root`. The settings come from `project.toml`, the preset and the repo override, and the layout
(state, worktrees) lives in the project folder. A project whose repo folder is missing or is not a git repo is
refused outright. A project is blocked when its settings failed closed (`factory project show` lists why), a
check command would be rejected, or `project.toml` has no valid `base_branch`. A blocked project refuses `run`,
`approve` and `kb-refresh`, the commands that start agents or merge.

### The project lease

At most one job is active per project. A running `run` or `approve` holds a lease file in the project's state
folder and renews it while it works. `factory status` starts with `project: free`, or with
`project: busy, job <id> (owner <who>, <n> s left)` while another process holds it. The busy message means that
process owns the project for about that many more seconds: wait for it, or stop it. A lease of a crashed process
expires on its own, and an expired or corrupt lease file is taken over.

### Rust preset checks

The rust preset has two check rules. `crates/*/**` runs `cargo check -j4 -p {crate}` and `cargo test -j4 -p {crate}`
for each changed workspace member. A second rule covers a single-crate repo: `src/**`, `tests/**`, `benches/**`,
`examples/**` and `build.rs` at the repo root run `cargo check -j4` and `cargo test -j4`. These paths are anchored
at the root, so a member's `crates/x/src/lib.rs` matches only the first rule. A virtual workspace (a root
`Cargo.toml` without a `[package]`) relies on the `crates/*/**` rule, because a bare `cargo check -j4` there would
check the whole workspace.

### Layers

Settings come from three layers, each on top of the one before:

1. the preset `config.toml`,
2. the `[settings]` table in the project's `project.toml`,
3. the repo override `.factory/override.toml`, read from the tip of the base branch (never the working tree).

A repo override may only add `risk_paths` and `checks`. Both are additive. Any other key, or an unreadable file,
makes the config fail closed. `.factory/**` is always a risk path, so a repo cannot change its own factory
settings without review.

The four prompt keys are `read_first` (files the builder reads first), `builder_rules`, `check_hints` and
`reviewer_rules`.

### Agent files

Agent files are merged by name from the preset `agents/` folder, the project `agents/` folder and the repo's
`.factory/agents/` folder on the base branch (later wins). The engine writes them to `.claude/agents/` in each new
job worktree. Only names like `factory-<name>.md` are written, they are git-excluded, and a file that is tracked
on the base branch is never overwritten.
